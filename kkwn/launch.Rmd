This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#install.packages('rsconnect')

rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='semey', token='E0FF219555C13A10E0E5158F2E0A90C4', secret='S1vefjyK/aGx0ykso0+1YxRRobFPOoayOiPr2vQc')

library(rsconnect)
    rsconnect::deployApp('D:/R_files/inequality_manuscript/app/kkwn')

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
